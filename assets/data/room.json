Also the S-train at Hackescher takes you to Zoo\/Tiergarten to see the West side of Berlin or one stop away to Friedrichstrasse \"Upper East Side of  Berlin\".  There is a park nearby where you can enjoy the river and a beer at the StrandBar.  Being so well located, you save money not having to take taxis, but when you do need one, there is a taxi stand around the corner (comes in handy for early morning flights!).","notes":"If questions about Berlin, startup & tech scene or however else I can advise - feel free to ask me.

The popular \"Samariterkiez\" is part of Friedrichshain and a mixed neighborhood of creatives, students and families. Right in our street you can see some colorful houses which used to be squatted.  In summer everybody is enjoying the sun in caf\u00e9s. Also you find little shops and a lot of restaurants on our doorstep.  Buzzing Simon-Dach-Str. with its many restaurants and bars you reach in less than 10 min by foot. For shopping we have many supermarkets  (including an organic one) a stone's throw away. Furthermore a 10 min walk away is a shopping center. Also the wonderful and big Volkspark Friedrichshain is nearby.

The tram M10 takes you in only 7 minutes to the RAW area ( there are lots of restaurants, bars, concert halls, flea markets in one very interesting industrial style complex). Just around the corner from there is also the famous East Side Gallery. There are some free parking spots on our street, but sometimes it can be difficult to find one.","access":"You can use our well-equipped kitchen with automatic coffee machine,  kettle, (free coffee and tea for you), your own shelf in the fridge, microwave,  a hot plate for cooking, dishwasher and washing machine.

The literal center piece of the apartment is a 40sqm living kitchen with balcony to cook, eat, meet other guest and myself and hang out. Everything","neighborhood_overview":"I absolutely adore the area I live in!!! It's super green, safe and quiet with the park and the small lake just across the street, you can walk to river Spree across the park.  At the same time, it\"s really close to all the happening areas, Kreuzberg, Neuk\u00f6lln and Friedrichshain. If you don\"t want to walk there or take a taxi, feel free to use my bicyles to get around!","notes":"One important reminder at this point:  I am a dog lover and my adorable dog Luna lives me in my flat. I do not believe that dogs are in any way unhygienic, at least not more than humans.  It is unavoidable despite all efforts to clean and hover the flat that there will be places where you spot dog hair.  If that is something that bothers or concerns you, I recommend looking for alternative options.","transit":"My place is conveniently located to public transport: closest S-bahn station is \"Treptower Park\" on the ring (circle) train  10min leisurely walk  through the park and bus stop just outside of the house","access":"I like my guests to feel 'at home away from home'.  With that, there are no limits to communal areas and rooms they can access or use, as long as they keep them clean and ready for use by others.  I appreciate if guests are not hiding in their room and keeping to themselves but I do encourage them to share the public spaces.  On the same note, I expect that guests do not regard their room as their private property and accept that I may have to access the room to get some things or occasionally use it while they are not using it themselves.  I am looking at this more than a shared flat with temporary guests than a hotel where people check in, do their thing and check out.  Of course, mutual respect and trust is the basis for this kind of openness which is both granted  by myself as well as expected from my guests.","house_rules":"I kindly ask my guest to respect the following house rules:  1. Kindly remove your shoes when entering the flat, I am happy to provide some extra shoes for the house. That protects the antique wooden parquet floor and reduces the noise level for my downstairs neighbor.  2. Smoking is not permitted inside the flat, only on both balconies. 3. Please respect my neighbors and avoid excessive noise in the flat, particularly between 10pm and 8am. This also includes the staircase when you return late at night.  NOTE: my downstairs neighbor has his bedroom under my kitchen. Noise travels more easily in an old house like mine. I recommend using the living room when you want to sit together in the evening to have drinks.  4. Parties are explicitly NOT allowed, unless you have prior approval, particularly if it involves inviting non-guests to the flat.  5. Please keep the kitchen area clean and tidy, put away into the dishwasher or wash any dirty dishes. 6.

I do not believe that dogs are in any way unhygienic, at least not more than humans.

With that, there are no limits to communal areas and rooms they can access or use, as long as they keep them clean and ready for use by others.  I appreciate if guests are not hiding in their room and keeping to themselves but I do encourage them to share the public spaces.  On the same note, I expect that guests do not regard their room as their private property and accept that I may have to access the room to get some things or use it while they are not using it themselves.  I am looking at this more than a shared flat with temporary guests than a hotel where people check in, do their thing and check out.  Of course, mutual respect and trust is the basis for this kind of openness which is both granted  by myself as well as expected from my guests.","house_rules":"I kindly ask my guest to respect the following house rules:  1. Please remove your shoes when entering the flat, I am happy to provide some extra shoes for the house.

Please respect my neighbors and avoid excessive noise in the flat, particularly between 10pm and 8am. This also includes the staircase when you return late at night.  NOTE: my downstairs neighbor has his bedroom under my kitchen. Noise travels more easily in an old house like mine. I recommend using the living room when you want to sit together in the evening to have drinks.  4. Parties are explicitly NOT allowed, unless you have prior approval, particularly if it involves inviting non-guests to the flat.  5.
